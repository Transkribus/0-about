This is a meta project for the Transkribus platform. All issues that are not related to a specific repository or affect multiple repositories should be opened here.

The Transkribus platform (https://transkribus.eu) was developed during the following EU-projects:

- Transcriptorium: http://transcriptorium.eu/
- READ: http://read.transkribus.eu

The repositories needed to run the local SWT based client are:

- PdfUtils
- fimagestoreClient
- TranskribusCore
- TranskribusClient
- TranskribusSwtGui

It is recommended to check them out with Eclipse, to configure them as Maven projects and run "maven install" on them in the given order.

Server repositories are currently kept private but will be made OpenSource during the course of the READ project
