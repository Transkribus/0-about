The Transkribus platform (https://transkribus.eu) was developed during the following EU-projects:

- Transcriptorium: http://transcriptorium.eu/
- READ: http://read.transkribus.eu

The repositories needed to run the local SWT based client are:

- PdfUtils
- fimagestoreClient
- TranskribusCore
- TranskribusClient
- TranskribusSwtGui

Server repositories are currently kept private but will be made OpenSource during the course of the READ project
